				<h1>I'm Nick Pascetti, aspiring web developer.</h1>
			</div>
			<p>Currently, I'm a podcast addict, maker of music, lover of craft (and non-craft) beers, cats, esoteric LucasArts &trade; adventure games, hiking and the outdoors ... <em>but</em> not necessarily in that order.</p>
			<p>In the past I've worked as a gigging musician, in organic food and produce distribution, and conducting ecological restoration and surveying ... <em>but</em> not all simultaneously.</p>
			<p>Looking to the future, I hope to start a career in web development ... <em>but</em> not until I've graduated from coding bootcamp! </p>
